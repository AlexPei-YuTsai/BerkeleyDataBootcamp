    "Overall, the children of this school district perform worse at math than at reading and barely 65% of children in this district passed both math and reading. If we're going by our standard of a 70% passing grade, the district overall has failed to provide the children with the education they need to succeed in life, though some schools have been performing better than others.\n",

    "Based purely on the data collected, it seems as if Charter schools yield higher math, reading, and overall performance than District schools. \n",

    "However, it's also important to note that Charter schools have smaller student populations than District schools in this school district and that there could be many societal and complex socioeconomic factors that go into the performance of their students. Considering how we do not know the tuition of each school, the insights collected in each of these sections are facile at best."

Assuming a standard teacher-student ratio of 1:18, each school would have about 150 teachers, and each teacher would only have \\\\$11,000 to spend on their students, and that's also only supposing that every cent the school receives goes to their teachers. If you consider the budget that has to be spent on utilities, supplies, and infrastructural maintenance and that the average school only allocates 30-40% of their budget to personnel, it's a mystery how these schools are paying their teachers.\n",

    "We have an even split between charter and regular public district schools in this school district. It may seem there's a large disparity between the funding each school is getting, but that's because bigger schools with more students generally receive more money in order to serve a larger population. Funding does look even when normalized by the student population of each school, though that conclusion by itself can be misleading as we do not have enough information to conclude whether that money is actually going to the kids as bigger schools have much larger utility bills and rent to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do know, however, is that reading schools across schools have generally been pretty acceptable with the poorest performing school barely hitting 80% pass rates. It's a relief to see there are schools with over 95% passing rates for reading. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for mathematics. Quite a few district schools have math passing rates around the mid to high 60s, which leads to them having an almost 50% chance for students to pass both reading and maths. It is not a good sign when a coin toss is as accurate of a predictor of a child's academic success as the school they attend."

    "This statistic could easily be misrepresented as we do not know the budget breakdown for each school and how much of that money is actually going to each child. Perhaps utility spending increases exponentially in proportion to the school's physical size, making large schools practically equivalent to concrete prisons with barely functional infrastructure leaving *pennies* to the children. Perhaps the charter schools with smaller reported tax-funded budgets have different outside foundations contributing financially, making the overall money spent per student higher than it actually is.\n",

There are only 2 \"Small\" schools and the size of each interval is not necessarily even equally spaced.

    "As previously discussed, it did seem that larger schools have lower passing rates than smaller ones, however, it's also important to note that all district schools are also part of the \"large\" category. Because of other confounding factors such as the administration of a school (District vs. Charter), currently we can only conclude that there is an association between school sizes and scores with bigger schools having poorer performance. Although it's easy to generalize and attribute reasons to decreased performance such as there not being enough resources and staff due to the overabundance of students, it's important to recognize that correlation does not imply causation."
