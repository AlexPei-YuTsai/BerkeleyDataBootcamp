# Alex's BerkeleyDataBootcamp File Repository
This repository contains most, if not all of the content I'm responsible for creating during my time in the Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp. This document describes what is in the repository and will be updated periodically to reflect new file uploads, changes, and thoughts I may have to offer.

The language used here might be a little crass and straightforward, but really this is my way of staying authentic in a time when ChatGPT can hallucinate truthy garbage for you regardless.

### Module 01 - [Excel](https://github.com/AlexPei-YuTsai/BerkeleyDataBootcamp/tree/main/Module01-ExcelChallenge)
Regardless of how lofty one's goals of machine learning and data science are, all data-processing begins at managing spreadsheets and understanding basic statistics. We learn pivot tables, conditional formatting, convenient functions, and data visualization here.
- Don't sleep on Excel. It's the one thing everybody uses regardless of their technical prowess and responsibilities.

### Module 02 - [Visual Basic for Applications](https://github.com/AlexPei-YuTsai/BerkeleyDataBootcamp/tree/main/Module02-VBAChallenge)
Aspiring data scientist's first IDE and programming language. We learn the basics of every language: Variables, Ifs, Loops, and Functions here. Had to read up about object methods and how to use them somewhere else, but the core fundamentals are still transferrable. Don't worry about that. We also learned to break down black boxes into smaller black boxes so we can figure out step-by-step how to get different things to function and get different functions to operate across different Objects within Excel.
- Basically, we looped through worksheets and processed numbers.

### Module 03 - [Python](https://github.com/AlexPei-YuTsai/BerkeleyDataBootcamp/tree/main/Module03-PythonChallenge)
More than half of data science pretty much relies on this or some library this language has to offer. Wanna do math and data analytics? Numpy and Matplotlib. Wanna do the same thing except with something that stands out more on a resume? Pandas. Wanna do Machine Learning and Linear Algebra? Pytorch and Tensorflow. Face-tracking applications that took 6 months for a PhD candidate to write can now be replicated in 20 minutes with a tutorial because of how many tools there are. We stand atop the shoulders of giants, but we still need scale the titans' backs.
- Learned file reading, writing, and manipulation here. Eventually there'll be more math.

### Module 04 - Python, but now with [Pandas](https://github.com/AlexPei-YuTsai/BerkeleyDataBootcamp/tree/main/Module04-PandasChallenge)
At some point, we'll have to handle Big Data that we can't efficiently manage on Excel. Pandas allows us to clean, aggregate, and analyze data quickly so we can collect the insights that matter. Garbage in, garbage out. The faster you get good data into your system, the faster you get good results from your Machine Learning black boxes. It's similar to Machine Learning applications like Rapidminer where the first step to processing any data is to do data preparation and clean up your garbage data.
- Advanced chart manipulation, basically.

### Module 05 - Python, but now with charts and Matplotlib
