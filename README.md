# Alex's BerkeleyDataBootcamp File Repository
This repository contains most, if not all of the content I'm responsible for creating during my time in the Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp. This document describes what is in the repository and will be updated periodically to reflect new file uploads, changes, and thoughts I may have to offer.

The language used here might be a little crass and straightforward, but really this is my way of staying authentic in a time when ChatGPT can hallucinate words for you anyways.

### Module 01 - Excel
Regardless of how lofty one's goals of machine learning and data science are, all data-processing begins at managing spreadsheets and understanding basic statistics. We learn pivot tables, conditional formatting, convenient functions, and data visualization here.

### Module 02 - Visual Basic for Applications
Aspiring data scientist's first IDE and programming language. We learn the basics of every language: Variables, Ifs, Loops, and Functions here. Had to read up about object methods and how to use them somewhere else, but the core fundamentals are still transferrable. Don't worry about that. We also learned to break down black boxes into smaller black boxes so we can figure out step-by-step how to get different things to function and get different functions to operate across different Objects within Excel.
- Basically, we looped through worksheets and processed numbers.
